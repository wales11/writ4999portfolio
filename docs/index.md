# Welcome to Corey's WRIT 4999 Portfolio

### Organization

I have organized this portfolio accoridng to four different main projects. I've completed these projects throughout my technical writing and communication courses, and I have added them to this portfolio.

#### Project 1

My first project is my resume, which is useful for employers and other people in my network. The formatting might be a bit innovative, but I wanted it to be accessible in a web format without linking to an external document.

#### Project 2

The second project is my senior capstone project, which is a research paper about how sabermetrics can be explained and distributed to a larger audience. I had a lot of fun doing this project, and it made me realize things that I want to pursue in the future, such as focusing on both baseball and statistics in my professional pursuits.

#### Project 3

Project 3 is a writing sample from a class I took on Rhetoric, Technology, and the Internet. For this class, I wrote a paper about sabermetrics and how baseball's approach over time has changed to use data and statistics for decisions. The paper provides an interesting insight into how baseball has embraced data and the use of it in its operations.

#### Project 4

My fourth and final project is a reflection I have written summarizing what I've learned throughout the WRIT 4999 class. I connected my senior capstone project to my previous experience in TWC and my professional identity.

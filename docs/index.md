# Welcome to Corey's WRIT 4999 Portfolio

### Organization

I have organized this portfolio accoridng to four different main projects. 

#### Project 1

My first project is my resume, which is useful for employers and other people in my network.

#### Project 2

The second project is my senior capstone project, which is a research paper about how sabermetrics can be explained and distributed to a larger audience.

#### Project 3

Project 3 is a writing sample from a class I took on Rhetoric, Technology, and the Internet. For this class, I wrote a paper about sabermetrics and how baseball's approach over time has changed to use data and statistics for decisions.

#### Project 4

My fourth and final project is a reflection I have written summarizing what I've learned throughout the WRIT 4999 class. I connected my senior capstone project to my previous experience in TWC and the connection to my professional identity.

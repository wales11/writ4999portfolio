#### Capstone Project

## Introduction

My senior capstone project is designed around advanced statistics and their use in baseball. Specifically, I am focusing on the research question, “How do fans of the game determine a player's value, and how can I help them understand how good certain players are through the use of sabermetrics?” The scope of this project spans the entirety of Major League Baseball (MLB), including its fanbase and its player base. However, I will focus on the fanbase that is more casual/wanting to learn more about advanced statistics. I will be writing a research paper to communicate my findings, and following up with a website that combines my findings with my future plan for this project after graduation.

## Background

The problem that I am addressing is the lack of understanding within baseball regarding advanced statistics, often called sabermetrics. Sabermetrics are the best way to evaluate players and compare them to one another, but they are not understood by a large majority of the baseball fanbase. My goal is to explain the way sabermetrics work in simple terms, and use examples of these sabermetrics from past player performance to put the explanation into practice. My audience are casual fans of baseball and people who want to better understand the value of players. The project's purpose is to educate people, mainly fans, on sabermetrics and the benefit that these stats have for determining player value. Contextual elements that are important include a pretty good understanding of baseball and how it works, as well as beginner knowledge of the counting statistics (hits [H], home runs [HR], runs batted in [RBI], runs [R], innings pitched [IP],  strikeouts [K], walks [BB]). In my experience, sabermetrics have been relegated to dedicated fan discussion and MLB professionals in charge of evaluating players and determining their salary. With my capstone project, I am hoping to increase the audience of people who understand sabermetrics and incorporate it into their MLB viewing experience. 

Before I go more in-depth on my capstone project, it is important to define sabermetrics, as it is a term that many people might be unfamiliar with and is used throughout my capstone project. The Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) defines sabermetrics as “the search for objective knowledge about baseball through analysis of the statistical record”. In a broad sense, sabermetrics means anything that resembles analyzing baseball through a statistical lens. However, when I refer to sabermetrics in this capstone project, I mean any advanced statistics that are frequently called sabermetrics. 

Furthermore, there are two main types of statistics in baseball. The first type is a counting statistic, which just means that as a player accumulates one more of that statistic, it goes up by one. The only mathematical process involved is addition. The second type of statistic is a rate statistic, which means that it is a statistic that involves division. For example, WHIP is a rate statistic. It is calculated by taking three counting statistics, walks allowed, hits allowed, and innings pitched, and using this formula (Walks Allowed + Hits Allowed)/(Innings Pitched) (Walks and hits per inning pitched (WHIP) 1).

## Literature review

### Golden Age of Tech Comm

This article by Miles Kimball (2017) gives a history of the different ages of technical communication, similar to the five ages that were present in Greek mythology. Technical communication got a start in the ages of World War II, and continued on throughout the past few decades. The notable eras were with the rise of other innovations such as computers and the internet. Currently, we are in the golden age of tech communication, according to Kimball. Furthermore, Kimball has high hopes for the future of technical communication, resonating the outlook that technical communication will grow as a field in the next decade.

### Existential Questions in Tech Comm

Saul Carliner (2017) wrote a paper about questions regarding the field of technical communication and common questions that they believe should be addressed further. The first question tackles the topic of what exactly is technical communication? Something I found interesting was the question regarding the chicken and the egg philosophical dilemma, but with tech comm and technical background. I agreed with the answer that it doesn’t matter which one comes first, as long as both are a priority to the technical communicator. 

### The All-Star Editor

Judith Tarutz (1990) has a very interesting piece comparing a technical writer to that of a catcher in baseball. As someone very knowledgeable in baseball and how it works, I would have to agree with their understanding of baseball and how the roles in baseball can be similar to those of a technical writer. Technical writers possess a wide range of skills, including helping the entire team, knowing what the team needs, as well as their individual strengths and weaknesses, seeing the entire field in regards to a writing project, and a salary that doesn’t reflect an individual’s contribution (I think the article might be a little outdated, and by a little, I mean 31 years). 

### Wake Forest dissertation

Nathaniel Stoltz (2014) composed a very well-done literature review on sabermetrics and their usage in news articles, MLB, and the media over the past few decades. There are a few trends identified by Nathaniel, but one that I found really interesting was how a lot of teams may have unknowingly used sabermetrics (only a little bit) before it was mainstream. Another point I noticed was that there was a direct correlation between teams who embraced sabermetrics early on and their success as a team. The most important thing, however, was the shift of teams from a subjective approach through scouting methods that used to be “this guy has a nice swing, and he has a good build” to “his advanced metrics look promising, and his ceiling is pretty high”. 

### Assessing worker knowledge outcomes

This presentation, given at an IEEE conference in 2010 by Okuda (2010), compares the problem of quantifying player performance and value into consolidated numbers that are easy to understand in baseball to quantify a worker’s contribution to a company. The process is described as first understanding how the workers operate, and then attempting to quantify it. There are many similarities between the two approaches, those being sabermetrics and socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization (SECI). Some similarities are the knowledge level and the level at which that knowledge is applied for the workplace, and similarly in baseball, the amount of adjustments made according to the advanced statistics, and the willingness to apply those adjustments.

### Why software is like baseball

This article by Valerdi (2017) showcases the similarities between sabermetrics and software, especially in recent years. The entirety of MLB and its philosophy has shifted in terms of how the game is played. The players are not the only ones shifting the way they approach the game either; fans are using many different sources to find out news and statistics, with one example being beat reporters on Twitter conveying statistics and news to their team’s fanbase. This article goes a little in-depth as to how some advanced statistical categories are calculated, and there really isn’t much about software, which I don’t mind personally. However, the main takeaway is that there are certain things that carry over from baseball to software, such as individual contributions, external factors adding uncertainty, and a change in approach due to observed data (Valerdi 3).

### Batting average and beyond

This research article by Arth and Billings (2021) was very comprehensive and extremely detailed about something relevant to my capstone project: the dissemination of sabermetrics. The easiest way to reach a larger audience is to have sabermetrics be displayed and talked about on MLB broadcasts, but broadcasters and those in charge of MLB broadcast graphics are still using the old statistics. Another unique issue within this debate is the topic of framing. Broadcasting companies and staff can choose which statistics to display on the screen, and these subjective choices may have negative effects for the average viewer. For example, let’s say an MLB team is in the top 5 of the old stats, or the counting stats, while being in the bottom 5 of sabermetrics. Will that team choose to display the advanced statistics, which paint a more accurate picture of their team’s performance? No, that team will pick whichever statistic benefits them the most, which is known as cherry picking. Cherry picking is a very real problem with sabermetrics, and MLB broadcasting increases that problem twofold as viewers only have access to the information that the graphics or announcers decide to highlight. Furthermore, when hitters come to the plate, the statistics that are shown are batting average, home runs, runs batted in, and on-base plus slugging. While the last one, OPS, is a step in the right direction, it isn’t enough. Save for a few specialized broadcasts on ESPN2 called Statcast broadcasts, the only statistics that are shown during the game are completely up to the broadcaster. Because of this, there is a large variation in how statistics are displayed for each team. 

| **Team** | **Total Stat** | **Adv Stat (%)** | **Neu Stat (%)** | **Trad Stat (%)** |
| :--- | | | | |
| White Sox | 972 | 29.1 | 3.1 | 67.8 |
| Cubs | 975 | 29.0 | 4.1 | 66.9 |
| Giants | 883 | 28.3 | 4.3 | 67.4 |
| Athletics | 873 | 27.0 | 4.0 | 69.0 |
| Phillies | 933 | 23.2 | 4.5 | 72.3 |
| Orioles | 898 | 20.6 | 3.7 | 75.7 |
| Mets | 825 | 20.4 | 6.2 | 73.5 |
| Blue Jays | 1017 | 20.0 | 2.6 | 77.5 |
| Yankees | 693 | 19.0 | 0.1 | 80.8 |
| Nationals | 870 | 15.7 | 3.9 | 80.3 |
| Rays | 508 | 15.4 | 0.0 | 84.6 |
| Red Sox | 965 | 14.5 | 14.6 | 70.9 |
| Royals | 621 | 8.5 | 11.8 | 79.7 |
| Indians | 581 | 7.1 | 0.2 | 92.8 |
| Astros | 518 | 6.8 | 2.1 | 91.1 |
| Angels | 526 | 6.8 | 2.5 | 90.7 |
| Reds | 642 | 6.1 | 1.9 | 92.1 |
| Padres | 619 | 6.1 | 0.0 | 93.9 |
| Braves | 676 | 5.9 | 2.7 | 91.4 |
| Mariners | 475 | 5.9 | 3.6 | 90.5 |
| Diamondbacks | 779 | 4.4 | 17.3 | 78.3 |
| Marlins | 766 | 4.3 | 1.8 | 93.9 |
| Rockies | 437 | 4.1 | 1.4 | 94.5 |
| Rangers | 605 | 3.5 | 19.7 | 76.9 |
| Cardinals | 680 | 1.5 | 14.0 | 84.6 |
| Brewers | 585 | 1.4 | 9.7 | 88.9 |
| Tigers|  711 | 1.1 | 15.3 | 83.5 |
| Twins | 741 | 1.1 | 16.3 | 82.6 |
| Dodgers | 592 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 98.0 |
| Pirates | 535 | 0.2  | 6.0 | 93.8 |
| **Average** | **716.7** | **12.9** | **6.1** | **81.0** | 

This table on page 12 from the article by Arth and Billings (2021) showcases the stark differences between each team’s willingness to use advanced statistics. All in all, the broad question of “How should broadcasting networks use advanced statistics in their broadcasts of MLB games?” might seem obvious to a fan of sabermetrics, but there are many other factors to consider. Above all, broadcasting companies are a business, and a majority of the regional networks have an indication that they will be bankrupt by the end of 2022. With this imminent bankruptcy in mind, will the broadcasting companies be focused on improving such a small part of their product in order to portray players in a more objective light? By portraying their players in a more objective light, the most common outcome is a temporarily confused audience and less confidence instilled in the player being highlighted. Personally, I do not think that this is anywhere near the broadcasting companies’ radar.

## Literature Review Themes

While this is a technical writing capstone project, some sources did not have technical writing and communication inherently present in them. Some sources were focused on technical writing with some of them having vague baseball terminology sprinkled throughout. Another source was comparing the role of the catcher to the role of the technical writer. There were also very in-depth sources about sabermetrics and baseball statistical analysis. The main takeaway from all of these sources is that baseball and technical writing do not have to be mutually exclusive. Throughout my research, I found that technical writing is present in baseball in many different ways. This was surprising to me as I had hit quite a few walls at the beginning of my capstone project in regards to finding enough relevant sources.

### Methods

I used a mixed methods approach to my capstone project research. I conducted an interview with someone currently working in an MLB front office. They use sabermetrics on a daily basis and also have unique insight from their career high up within an MLB organization. I also interviewed three different casual fans that I think is the average audience member between old stats and really advanced sabermetrics. I will include their responses in this draft below.

### Participant 1 (Front Office/Industry Professional)

If you had to pick one stat that every baseball fan should know, which one would you pick?
I would pick FanGraphs WAR (fWAR). Most baseball fans already know the basic stats like batting average and earned run average, which are valuable and useful ways to estimate one part of a position player or pitcher’s performance, but WAR, specifically fWAR, is the easiest way to estimate the all-encompassing value of a position player or pitcher in just one number.

#### How in-depth would you go? (cover FIP, wRC+, BABIP, ERA+) or deeper?

If I wanted to teach a baseball fan about all the different traditional “sabermetrics” that are out there, particularly in baseball research written by journalists and amateur researchers, metrics such as FIP and wRC+ are definitely essential. However, in most player evaluation contexts, at least in professional scouting, FIP and wRC+ are not viable due to how broad they are. Obviously the higher a hitter’s wRC+ is, the “better” he is, but beyond that, wRC+ tells you nothing (Weighted runs created plus (WRC+) 1). If I wanted to teach a baseball fan about which metrics to use to evaluate a player’s actual skillset as a hitter, I would cover more granular metrics such as chase rate, expected slugging, or even 90th percentile exit velocity because they are much more relevant and more commonly used.

#### Is there anything that you use to evaluate player performance that surprised you?

I’m surprised by how quickly and how totally pitcher performance evaluation has been taken over by examining their pitch metrics, i.e. the movement profiles and velocity separation of their pitches. Of course the strikeout rate and walk rate of a pitcher is essential to know, but to really dig deep into how and why a certain pitcher gets outs (or doesn’t get outs), evaluating his pitch metrics has become incredibly commonplace.

#### What is your opinion on things that can’t be accounted for using statistics, such as clubhouse presence, veteran leadership, catcher pitch selection, etc.?

There’s a saying in baseball coaching: if hitting, power, fielding, running, and throwing are the five tools, then winning is the sixth tool. In my opinion, certain players innately possess characteristics that make them winners that cannot and will never be captured by statistics. Conversely, some players are simply losers that detract from the club, and statistics will never notice that either.

#### What do you say to people who think that advanced stats ruin the game or take the fun out of baseball?

Depending on the person’s definition of “advanced stats”, I would perhaps say that I agree with them. There are definitely times when introducing esoteric and uninteresting statistics like SIERA or catcher ERA in fan-facing situations would usually make the game less fun, since most of the audience would likely not know or have any interest in such things (Skill-interactive earned run average (Siera) 1). However, in terms of major league organizations employing advanced stats to evaluate and acquire players, that does not at all ruin the game, because major league organizations have been using seemingly incomprehensible numbers and figures such as the 20-80 grading scale and makeup questionnaires for decades and decades, and nobody complained about anything like that “ruining the game” until recently (McDaniel 2).

#### Can you think of downsides to using advanced statistics, such as cherry picking?

The only real, consequential downside of using advanced statistics is the possibility of looking so far into the new-fangled numbers that you lose sight of more traditionally reliable metrics and qualities. Take a real-world example from the 2021 season: if you only look at Albert Pujols’s “advanced” statistics such as WAR, walk rate, strikeout rate, and wRC+, you would figure that he is a far below average player that belongs in Triple-A. However, if you additionally factor in both traditional stats and intangible qualities, you will notice that he hit a respectable 17 home runs in 296 plate appearances, and that he also brings an invaluable veteran presence that will instantly step into a leadership role, especially for the Spanish-speaking players on the team.

#### Where should this information be distributed to reach more fans? Broadcasts, social media, etc.

Advanced statistics should not be distributed via any vectors with the intention to “reach” fans. If the MLB wants to “reach” more fans, it needs to improve the on-field product and dramatically increase social media engagement.

#### Do you have any interesting comparisons that can be made in terms of guys you wouldn’t think were good but are quietly good once you look deeper?

Players that reveal themselves to be quietly good after a deep dive into their advanced numbers definitely exist, but they are few and far between. It is more common to discover a player as being quietly good after learning he brings an intangible impact on the game such as elite pitch-calling as a catcher or infectious competitiveness, or after learning that he has an elite work ethic or leadership qualities.

| Question | Casual Fan 1 | Casual Fan 2 | Casual Fan 3 |
| :---     |              |              |        ---:  |
| If you had to pick one statistic that every baseball fan should know, which one would you pick? | OPS | WAR | WAR |
| What statistic do you wish you knew more about? | wOBA | OPS+ | How WAR is calculated |
| Where would you like to see this information disseminated? | MLB Network | During official MLB broadcasts | On baseball statistical websites |
|What is your go-to stat to see if a player is good or not? | fWAR | Triple Slash Line and OPS | For batters: OPS For pitchers: WHIP |
| What do you wish you knew when you were learning about advanced statistics? | How they contribute to a player’s value | The league average of each stat in the current year | Whether or not the stats geeks actually watch and enjoy baseball or if they are only in it for the math |
| Can you think of downsides to using advanced statistics? | It is difficult for an uninvested baseball fan to understand | It can be confusing at times and distract from actually enjoying the game, “missing the forest for the trees” | Most advanced statistics are not situational. That is, they do not take into account how a player does under pressure. An old adage comes to mind, “There are no clutch hitters, but there are players who get clutch hits.” |
| What do you primarily use to learn more about advanced statistics? | Fangraphs or Baseball Savant | MLB app and Baseball-reference |Fangraphs and Baseball-reference |
| Are there any players that you think are better than their statistics say? | Max Kepler | Keston Hiura | Pitchers |

## Results

There are quite a few differences between the people who observe baseball as a fan and the person who works in an MLB front office. The first two questions about a statistic to pick and a statistic to learn more about are varied across the board. The third question, about where fans would like to see this information distributed, was also varied but it had the same goal in mind: reach more fans. While some believe it is best to do this via baseball broadcasts, another believes that baseball statistical websites are the best medium for it. I think this comes down to a difference in philosophy; the first two participants believe that sabermetrics should be shown on broadcasts, while the last participant believes sabermetrics is something that people should seek out, rather than be exposed to while watching a game. With the fourth question, there is again a difference in opinion. Every respondent had a different answer, indicating to me that the way people evaluate baseball players differs. However, what I can do is give baseball fans the tools in order to know more about their chosen evaluating statistics, and they can continue to use those same evaluators with newfound knowledge in hand. 

The fifth question goes into what people who already know some information about sabermetrics wish they knew when they were starting out. There were two responses talking about specific things related to advanced statistics, the first one wanting clarification on how player value is related to sabermetrics, and the second one wanting to know how the player compares to the league average for a year, which would be something like OPS+ or ERA+, which are better explained by MLB glossary (Adjusted earned run average (ERA+) 1). The third response was quite funny; talking about if the people that frequently work with sabermetrics actually like baseball or if they only like the math part of it. Honestly, that’s a pretty fair question to ask. For me personally, the love of baseball combined with my proficiency in statistics fostered my own love for sabermetrics. The sixth question asks about downsides to sabermetrics, which, believe it or not, there are downsides to sabermetrics. The first response brings up a very good point that is often overlooked. No matter how accessible I can make information about sabermetrics, or how effective my explanations are, some people just won’t be interested in it. The second point about it being confusing is a common problem that people getting into sabermetrics face. They focus on the math behind the statistics rather than the parameters of the finished statistics for each player that is laid out in a simple manner, such as statistics that are adjusted for the league. These statistics, such as OPS+, are quite easy to follow. The average for the league is 100, and when the number is below 100, they are that far below average. Similarly, when the number is above 100, they are that far above the average. For example, a player with a 140 OPS+ is 40% better than the league average, and a player with an 85 OPS+ is 15% worse than the league average (On-base plus slugging plus (OPS+) 1).

The last two questions do not have much substance to them, as they were designed to be questions with very specific answers. Each participant uses the most prevalent baseball statistical websites such as Fangraphs, Baseball-reference, Baseball Savant, and MLB. These are all great resources to use for anything baseball related, especially advanced statistics. The last question was more of a curiosity question on my end, but also if there were any players that the people I interviewed thought were better than their stats indicated. The results were kind of funny to me, as Max Kepler has been ranked last or very close to last in a statistical category called BABIP for the last few years. “This year’s .227 BABIP, while a career-low and third-worst in the league, is within range of his .248 BABIP from 2018 to 2020. This is who Kepler is at this point” (Gleeman and Hayes 4). Furthermore, Keston Hiura has been in and out of Triple-A, which is the level below MLB the last two years. “The plan was to keep Keston Hiura in Triple A for a while longer. How long? No one knew with certainty. Just last week, Brewers manager Craig Counsell said that the situation needed ‘space’” (Sammon 1).
The industry professional thinks that sabermetrics should be something a person seeks out on their own, and the casual fans believe that advanced statistics should be used on baseball broadcasts. Similarly, among the casual fans, there are various degrees as to which statistics people want more knowledge on. As a whole, I believe that fans just want more information about baseball statistics in general. Likewise, it is important to denote, as said by the industry professional, that there are certain things MLB organizations look for that are not quantitative, such as leadership, veteran presence, and foreign language fluency. 

## Recommendations

While I have bigger plans for the future of this capstone project, I will focus on what I am able to do in the scope of this research paper. However, I am planning on making a website with information about sabermetrics that can be shown to baseball fans and anyone else interested in learning more about sabermetrics or baseball in general. What I can recommend in this research paper is two things. The first recommendation is that there needs to be more research done into this topic. Four interviews being done with both people working in the field and those who casually watch the games and enjoy baseball are enough for this capstone project and research paper, but they are not enough to come to a statistically significant conclusion. Because of this, there needs to be more research done, more interviews conducted, and also a survey of a large and diverse population of the baseball audience done. The information I got from the one person I interviewed who works in an MLB front office was immensely helpful to see into the mind of someone who deals with more advanced statistics on a daily basis than the average fan will over the course of a season. It was very interesting to see the MLB front office worker did not actually focus too much on sabermetrics when looking at a player for their organization to acquire, either in a trade or in a draft. There were certain qualities that players exhibit which are not captured by statistics, which was really interesting to me. I always knew that certain players are kept around for things like veteran presence, foreign language fluency, and ability to mentor the younger players, but I did not know that it was more sought after than what I previously thought.  

The second recommendation is from me to MLB as a whole. MLB has a great product, and they have amazing players from so many different backgrounds, stories, and life circumstances. However, MLB fails to market their product to any specific audience, as well as neglect the younger generation as a whole. There is a divide in the baseball community that still exists to this day between the older generation and the younger generation. The younger generation is much less likely to be pulled in to their product and stay pulled in, while the older generation has always loved baseball and will enjoy the game no matter what. The biggest thing for the younger generation is social media outreach and being able to relate to the game. The vast majority of baseball announcers and broadcasts are catered to an older audience, but there is still hope. For example, an article by Vrabel details an older fan’s perspective on the inclusion of sabermetrics within baseball broadcasting, “If Charlie Blackmon is -8 outs above average, is that good or bad for Charlie Blackmon? How does an allegedly helpful stat use a triple negative?” (Vrabel 1). Going back to my earlier analysis of the journal by Arth and Billings (2021), there was a mention of the rare Statcast broadcasts which utilize younger broadcasters and a panel of broadcasters who discuss sabermetrics and have various advanced statistics displayed on screen during the game. What MLB can do without changing their business model at all is to increase the number of these broadcasts from a few per year to once a week, like their current model for games broadcast on YouTube (Brown 2). I believe that this will provide an easy transition for MLB to utilize more sabermetric information within their broadcasts, and it takes the pressure off of regional broadcasting networks that are already worried about going bankrupt and appealing to their specific regional audience. MLB can set an example that will be followed by the regional broadcasters, and hopefully lead to a change in the way sabermetrics are used in baseball broadcasting as a whole.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, my senior capstone project still has some things it needs to address. I plan to use the skills I’ve gained from CLA’s core competencies through my technical writing and communication courses and my experience in technical writing to improve on my project for the future. This project tackles an issue very near and dear to technical writing: taking a complex topic or issue and describing it in an easy-to-understand manner to a wide variety of audiences. This definition of technical writing is something I’ve kept in mind throughout the duration of this capstone project, and it is something I will continue to use as I begin my career in technical writing. My hope is to combine my passion for baseball and my skills in technical writing for a future job in baseball, and this capstone project is a great way to show my proficiency in both areas. Furthermore, the core competencies I most closely used for this project were analytical and critical thinking, and oral and written communication. The former was used both in my research and in coming up with a solution to my research question. The latter was used to present my results to my peers in the form of an oral presentation, and a written research paper to accompany that presentation (Career readiness 3). I had a great time conducting all of this research for my senior capstone project, especially doing the primary research, because I love talking about baseball. I am looking forward to expanding upon this project in the future both personally and professionally.
